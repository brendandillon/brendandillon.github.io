<p>I don't know what I am doing in Vim. I decided to start trying to pick it up about a week ago so that I could get comfortable with it while I had a short break from doing much work. I have figured out how to make the colors pretty, get around in NERDTree, and use hjkl instead of the arrow keys, but that is about it. Still, though, I can definitely see how someone who knows what they are doing would be quick in this. For example, I found out that I can just type "dip" and it deletes a block of code. Why? I don't know. Well, I maybe sort of know. "d" definitely refers to delete, as I have been reminded MANY TIMES by Vim already. "p" probably refers to paragraph, because Vim's most common usage is clearly for essay-writing. (I snark, but I am typing out this blog post in Vim.) What, though, does "i" refer to?</p>

<ul>
<li>iridescent</li>
<li>ignorant</li>
<li>Imapneman, like the girl, you know, from the song, you know, from the elevators</li>
<li>I definitely should not have a blog</li>
</ul>

<p>Back to Vim. I accidentally saved HTML files into the root directory of my last project just before presenting it. Given, I at least had the foresight to avoid commiting those files, but I still very clearly don't know what I'm doing in this program or in this blog.</p>

<p>If I have two entries it will look more like a real blog!</p>
