<p>It has happened. The fruit flies have returned. My slavish devotion to not providing them with any temptation, any fermenty-fruity-sugary smells, has finally collapsed over a soaking rice cooker. I made rice a few days ago, leaving the stuff that was stuck to the bottom soaking in water to loosen it up. Now to set the scene a little, it was a pretty joyous day. I had just completed my first module at the Turing School and recieved a good evaluation on my project. It was warm, but not too hot. I was looking at a week with fairly minimal work to do. In all this celebratory fervor, however, I made the mistake of saying "eh, I'll do the dishes later". The next morning I wound up meeting my dad for a race and spending the night over at my parent's house. When I came back the next day, I immediately was hit by the smell of what I had done. I had allowed the rice to ferment. My sink was Pigpen in stainless steel.</p>

<p>This happened last summer too, but I was living a gross life last summer and I needed some sort of a plague to get me out of it. The feeling of hypocracy consumed me whenever I came home, put a vegetarian meal on the stove, and went on a genocidal rampage against the fruit flies. It wasn't until winter finally took them that my apartment stopped sounding like a vuvuzuela. This infestation still has not reached the levels of last year, as I immediately cleaned every dish I owned and sprinted my trash to the dumpster, but I fear that this smaller colony of flies (do flies have colonies? I feel like squadron would be a good name for a group of flies) might be with me until the cold hits.</p>
